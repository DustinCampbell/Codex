Decouple text and semantic ingestion

Text ingestion must be performed along with or prior to semantic ingestion

Ingestion kinds:

Source Control Ingestion - adding commits/changesets from various branches in a source control repository
	This approach is modeled after git commits. Commits point to a description

Don't 'decompress' when uploading during ingestion. Attach compressed collections to bound source file.
